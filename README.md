#### Development 

To use the plugin for development purposes, clone the repository locally,
install poetry, a python dependencies management tool see https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation
then using the poetry tool, update the poetry lock file and install plugin dependencies by running 
```sh
poetry update --lock
poetry install --no-dev
```

To install the plugin into the QGIS application use the below command
```sh
poetry run python admin.py install
```

#### Testing
To run the unit tests, run the `run-tests.sh` script. This will spin up the QGIS
docker container for several versions of QGIS and execute the unit tests.
```sh
./run-tests.sh
```
