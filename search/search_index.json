Calculating NDVI using Sentinel 2 Imagery What is NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) NDVI is an indicator used in assessing whether the target(e.g. space imagery) being observed contains live green vegetation. NDVI is built from the red(R) and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The normalized vegetation index highlights the difference between the red band and the near-infrared band. NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R) This index is susceptible to the vegetation intensity and quantity. NDVI values range from -1 to +1, the negative values correspond to surfaces other than plant covers, such as snow, water, or clouds for which the red reflectance is higher than the near-infrared reflectance. For bare soil, the reflectances are approximately the same in the red and near-infrared bands, the NDVI presents values close to 0. The vegetation formations have positive NDVI values, generally between 0.1 and 0.7. The highest values correspond to the densest cover. NDVI is used in agriculture to assess the strength and quantity of vegetation by analyzing remote sensing measurements. NDVI is often used in precision agriculture decision-making tools. NDVI calculator on data provided using the plugin The plugin through STAC API catalogs can provide imagery that can be downloaded and used to calculate NDVI in the QGIS desktop application. Follow the below steps to calculate NDVI on imagery acquiring the data using the plugin. Load the STAC API Browser plugin, then select a STAC API provider that offers imagery that contain assets with infrared and red bands. Search for the required items in the selected STAC API catalog. Screenshot showing available items one of Microsoft Planetary Computer catalog collections . From the search results, select View assets on the item that contain targeted imagery and click Add asset as layer to load the required assets into QGIS. After the assets have been loaded successfully into QGIS as a COG layers. Open the raster calculator that is available from Raster > Raster Calculator menu or from the Processing Toolbox . Inside the calculator dialog, add the NDVI formula NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R) into the expression text box, where NIR is the layer with infrared band and R is the layer with the red band. After adding the formular, click Ok to execute the formula. If the calculation is successful the resulting layer with NDVI computation will be loaded into QGIS. Example of a styled NDVI imagery .

STAC API services that adhere and conform to the standard STAC specification and practices are recommended to be used in order to fully utilize the usage of the available plugin features. Features The plugin features can be categorized in two parts, search of STAC resources and access of STAC assets. Search of STAC resources The STAC API specification allows search for core catalog API capabilities and search for STAC item object. The plugin support item search and provides filters that can be used along with the search. The corresponding STAC API service used when searching needs to ensure that it has implemented the /search API endpoint accordingly to the specification, see https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/item-search . The plugin contains the following filters that can be used when searching for STAC items objects. Date filter - users can search for single instant temporal resources or resources with a temporal range. Spatial extent filter - users can provide a bounding box from which the results should be filtered against Advanced Filter - this enables usage of STAC API filter languages to provide advanced queries for the search for more information see https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/filter . Accessing STAC assets Each STAC Item object contains a number of assets and a footprint which a GeoJSON geometry that defines the full footprint of the assets represented by an item. The plugin search results items contain a dedicated dialog for viewing, loading and downloading item assets into QGIS, see adding assets section for more details. How to use After installing the plugin in QGIS, the following sections provides a guide on how to use the plugin. For the installation procedure see installation page . Launching the STAC API Browser plugin Three plugin menus can be used to launch the plugin in QGIS. QGIS toolbar In QGIS toolbar, there will be a plugin entry with the STAC APIs Browser icon.

To add a new STAC API service connection, click the New connection button, add the required details and click ok to save the connection. Connection dialog with a Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC API details The connection dialog contains a API Capabilities field which can be used to set the connection to use a SAS Token signing mechanism . The signing mechanism includes a token that have expiry period, Users should research the API after the period passes in order to resign the items. The Advanced group contain a list of the conformances type that the STAC API adhere to, when creating new connections the list is empty, users can click the Get conformance classes button to fetch the conformance classes. The above image shows the Planetary Computer STAC API with a list of conformances classes that have already been fetched. STAC API Items search Using the search filters All the search filters can be used only when their corresponding group boxes have been checked.
